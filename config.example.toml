# Additional binary paths for SSL library detection
#
# IMPORTANT: If you use NVM, pyenv, conda, or other version managers,
# you may need to add the SSL library paths for those installations.
#
# Common paths that may need to be added:
#
# NVM Node.js (statically linked OpenSSL - needs binary path):
#   - ~/.nvm/versions/node/v20.10.0/bin/node
#   - ~/.nvm/versions/node/v18.19.0/bin/node
#
# pyenv Python (usually works with system SSL, but check):
#   - ~/.pyenv/versions/3.11.0/lib/libssl.so
#
# Miniconda/Anaconda (bundles own OpenSSL):
#   - ~/miniconda3/lib/libssl.so.3
#   - ~/anaconda3/lib/libssl.so.3
#
# Homebrew on Linux:
#   - /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/lib/libssl.so.3
#
# Example with NVM paths (uncomment and adjust version):
# ssl_binary_paths = [
#     "/home/myuser/.nvm/versions/node/v20.10.0/bin/node",
#     "/home/myuser/miniconda3/lib/libssl.so.3"
