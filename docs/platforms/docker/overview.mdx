description: Run OISP Sensor in Docker containers
---


Run OISP Sensor as a Docker container for portable deployment across any Linux distribution.

## When to Use Docker

**Use Docker when:**
- Running on an unsupported Linux distribution
- Need portable deployment
- Want to avoid package installation
- Testing or development
- Running alongside application containers

**Use native installation when:**
- Running in production (better performance)
- System-wide monitoring needed
- Need auto-start on boot

## Requirements

- Linux host (Docker doesn't work for full capture on macOS/Windows)
- Docker 20.10+
- Privileged mode (for eBPF)
- Host network mode (for SSL capture)

## Capabilities

✅ **Full SSL/TLS capture** (same as native Linux)
✅ **All event types** supported
✅ **All AI providers** detected

## Container Image

**Registry:** `ghcr.io/oximyhq/sensor`

**Tags:**
- `latest` - Latest stable release
- `v0.2.0` - Specific version
- `main` - Latest development build

## Next Steps

- [Running with Docker](./running) - Run the container
- [Docker Compose](./compose) - Multi-container setup
