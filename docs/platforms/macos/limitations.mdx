<Tip title="Beta Release">
macOS support is implemented and functional. This page documents known limitations and areas needing more testing.
</Tip>

## How macOS Differs from Linux

| Feature | Linux | macOS |
|---------|-------|-------|
| Capture method | eBPF (kernel) | Network Extension (user space) |
| TLS decryption | uprobes on OpenSSL | TLS MITM proxy |
| Privileges | CAP_BPF | System Extension approval |
| Signing | None required | Apple Developer ID |
| Installation | Download binary | Signed app + user approval |

---

## Known Limitations

### CA Certificate Trust

Users must manually trust the OISP CA certificate in Keychain. Some applications (especially browsers) may show certificate warnings until:

1. The CA is properly installed to System Keychain
2. The application is restarted after trusting

### Application Compatibility

Some applications may not work with TLS MITM:

| Application Type | Status | Notes |
|------------------|:------:|-------|
| Most apps | ✅ Works | Standard TLS works fine |
| Certificate pinning | ⚠️ Limited | Apps with cert pinning may fail |
| Custom TLS | ⚠️ Limited | Non-standard TLS implementations |

### Performance

- First connection to each domain has slight latency (certificate generation)
- Very high-throughput applications may see minor slowdown

## What Needs Testing

We're actively seeking feedback on:

- **Long-running stability** — Does it work reliably for hours/days?
- **Different AI SDKs** — Python, Node.js, curl, etc.
- **Edge cases** — Streaming, large responses, concurrent requests
- **Memory usage** — Under sustained load

---

## Workarounds

### Certificate Issues

If you see certificate errors:

1. Re-install CA via menu bar → "Install CA Certificate"
2. Restart the affected application
3. Check Keychain Access → ensure OISP CA is "Always Trust"

### Extension Issues

If traffic isn't being captured:

1. Check System Settings → Privacy & Security → Network Extensions
2. Ensure OISP extension is enabled
3. Try restarting the app

## Reporting Issues

If you encounter problems:

1. Run with debug: `RUST_LOG=debug /path/to/oisp-sensor`
2. Note the macOS version and affected application
3. File an issue on GitHub with logs
