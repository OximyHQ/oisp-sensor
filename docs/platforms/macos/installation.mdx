description: Install OISP Sensor on macOS
---

<Tip title="Beta Release">
macOS support is **implemented and functional** but needs more real-world testing. We welcome feedback!
</Tip>

## Requirements

- macOS 13.0 (Ventura) or later
- Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3/M4) or Intel Mac
- Admin access (for extension approval)

---

## Installation

### Option 1: Download DMG (Recommended)

1. Download `OISP.dmg` from the [releases page](https://github.com/oximyhq/sensor/releases)
2. Open the DMG and drag OISP to Applications
3. Open OISP from Applications
4. Follow the setup wizard

### Option 2: Build from Source

```bash
# Prerequisites
# - Xcode 15 or later
# - xcodegen (brew install xcodegen)
# - Rust toolchain (rustup)

# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/oximyhq/sensor.git
cd oisp-sensor/macos

# Generate Xcode project
xcodegen generate

# Build with Xcode
xcodebuild -project OISP.xcodeproj -scheme OISP -configuration Release build

# Or use the release build script (requires Apple Developer ID)
./Scripts/build-release.sh --team YOUR_TEAM_ID
```

## Setup

### 1. Approve Network Extension

When you first launch OISP, macOS will prompt you to allow the Network Extension:

1. Click **"Open System Settings"** when prompted
2. Go to **Privacy & Security** → **Network Extensions**
3. Toggle **OISP Network Extension** to **Allow**

<Note>
This requires admin authentication. The extension intercepts network traffic to AI provider domains only.
</Note>

### 2. Trust CA Certificate

OISP uses a local Certificate Authority to decrypt HTTPS traffic:

1. Click **"Install CA Certificate"** in the OISP menu bar app
2. Enter your admin password when prompted
3. The certificate is added to System Keychain

<Warning>
The CA certificate is only used for connections to AI provider domains. All other HTTPS traffic passes through unchanged.
</Warning>

### 3. Start Capture

1. Click the OISP icon in the menu bar
2. Click **"Start Capture"**
3. AI traffic will now be captured

---

## Verify Installation

### Check Extension Status

```bash
# List system extensions
systemextensionsctl list
```

You should see `com.oisp.networkextension` with status `enabled_active`.

### Check CA Certificate

Open **Keychain Access** and search for "OISP". You should see the OISP CA certificate marked as trusted.

### Test Capture

Make an API call and check the web UI:

```bash
# Make a test API call
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/models \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY"

# Open web UI
open http://localhost:7777
```

## Uninstallation

### 1. Remove Extension

1. Open **System Settings** → **Privacy & Security** → **Network Extensions**
2. Toggle **OISP Network Extension** to off
3. Or run: `systemextensionsctl uninstall com.oisp.networkextension`

### 2. Remove CA Certificate

1. Open **Keychain Access**
2. Search for "OISP"
3. Delete the OISP CA certificate

### 3. Remove App

1. Quit OISP from the menu bar
2. Drag OISP from Applications to Trash

---

## Troubleshooting

### Extension won't load

1. Check **System Settings** → **Privacy & Security** → **Network Extensions**
2. Ensure OISP is allowed
3. Try restarting your Mac

### Certificate errors

1. Verify the CA is in System Keychain (not login keychain)
2. Check it's marked as "Always Trust"
3. Restart browser/application after trusting

### No events captured

1. Check the extension is running: `systemextensionsctl list`
2. Verify capture is started in menu bar app
3. Run with debug: `RUST_LOG=debug /path/to/oisp-sensor`
