<Tip title="Beta Release">
Windows support is implemented and functional. We welcome feedback on any issues!
</Tip>

Capture AI API calls from any application on Windows.

---

## Prerequisites

- Windows 10/11 (64-bit)
- OISP installed (see [Installation](./installation))
- CA certificate installed
- Administrator privileges

---

## Start Capturing

1. **Launch OISP** from the Start Menu or system tray

2. **Install CA** (first time) — Right-click tray icon → "Install CA Certificate"

3. **Start Capture** — Right-click tray icon → "Start Capture"
   - Accept the UAC prompt (WinDivert needs elevation)

4. **Open Web UI** — Go to [http://localhost:7777](http://localhost:7777)

---

## Generate AI Activity

Make an AI API call to test:

### Python

```python
import openai
client = openai.OpenAI()
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]
)
print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

### PowerShell

```powershell
$headers = @{
    "Content-Type" = "application/json"
    "Authorization" = "Bearer $env:OPENAI_API_KEY"
}
$body = @{
    model = "gpt-4o-mini"
    messages = @(@{role = "user"; content = "Hello!"})
} | ConvertTo-Json

Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions" -Method Post -Headers $headers -Body $body
```

### Any AI Tool

Use Cursor, Claude CLI, ChatGPT apps, or any AI application. OISP captures it automatically.

---

## See Events

The Web UI at [http://localhost:7777](http://localhost:7777) shows:

- **ai.request** — Outgoing API calls
- **ai.response** — Responses with tokens and latency
- **Process info** — Which app made each call

---

## Tray Icon Controls

Right-click the OISP icon in the system tray:

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Start Capture** | Begin intercepting AI traffic |
| **Stop Capture** | Pause capture |
| **Install CA Certificate** | Add CA to Windows trust store |
| **Settings** | Configure exports, filters |
| **Exit** | Quit OISP |

---

## Tray Icon Colors

| Color | Status |
|-------|--------|
| **Green** | Capturing |
| **Yellow** | Running but not capturing |
| **Red** | Error |

---

## Troubleshooting

### No events appearing?

1. **Check tray icon is green** — Capture must be started
2. **Check CA is installed** — certmgr.msc → Trusted Root CAs
3. **Check WinDivert** — Run `sc query WinDivert` in Admin PowerShell

### UAC prompt every time?

This is normal. WinDivert requires elevation. You can configure auto-start to reduce prompts.

### Antivirus blocking?

Add OISP folder to antivirus exclusions. WinDivert drivers may be flagged.
